         <h4>A Message from the Dean</h4>
         <p>Welcome to the Frank H. Dotterweich College of Engineering at Texas A&M University-Kingsville.  Home of the Javelina Engineers!</p>
         <p>The College is a leading provider of exciting and foundational engineering education in South Texas and is located on the historic campus of Texas A&M University-Kingsville.  The College is named for a pioneer in natural gas engineering, Dr. Frank H. Dotterweich.  The College was founded in 1936 and is built on the legacy of “Doc” Dotterweich and his colleagues when the University was known as Texas College of Arts and Industries and Texas A&amp;M University.  Today, the College is home to nearly 3,200 aspiring undergraduate and graduate engineering and technology majors.  Our alumni have achieved significant professional successes and are found all over Texas, throughout the nation, and around the globe.</p>
         <p>The College houses six departments offering 9 undergraduate and 11 graduate programs.  Our undergraduate programs in Architectural Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.  Our undergraduate program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.  The BS in Natural Gas Engineering program returned in the Fall of 2012 and is accepting students into what promises to be one of the most in-demand career paths of the 21st century.  In addition, the College is home to an Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE)-accredited program in Industrial Management and Technology.  Each of our undergraduate programs offers a rigorous educational experience with a solid theoretical basis augmented with hands-on laboratory and field-based experiences.  And each provides a challenging educational experience that blends teamwork and communication skills in a project-based learning environment.</p>
         <p>Graduate program offerings include MS degrees in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Industrial Management, Natural Gas Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.  The College is also home to a nationally ranked Ph.D. program in Environmental Engineering and an innovative PhD program in Sustainable Energy Systems Engineering.  Graduate students have research opportunities in a wide range of exciting multi-disciplinary areas such as environmental sustainability, high performance computing, energy systems, robotics and materials.  To support cutting-edge research, the University has invested in faculty and research laboratories.  Our annual research expenditures are approximately $3 million – much of that going to support student researchers.</p>
         <p>I encourage you to explore our website and the pertinent information on all of our departments and program offerings.  Join us, the Javelina Engineers, as we continue to contribute to the innovations and technological achievements that characterize our nation and the spirit of South Texas. </p>

         <h4>A Message from the Dean</h4>
         <p>Offering education in the practical side of the arts, Arts Study courses may specialize in painting, culinary arts, arts business, sculpture, culture and more. Students enrolled in Arts Study courses will be expected to engage in hands-on activities and projects, offering practical learning opportunities and the chance to immerse oneself in one's craft. These courses are equally suited to full-time artists, students, working professionals or others with an interest in Arts Study.</p>
         <p>Universities and academic institutions offering Arts Study courses typically provide the studio space and classroom areas to be used during the course, but students are often required to purchase and bring their own art-making materials, such as pencils, paper, paints, clay, cameras, etc. In Arts Study courses, it is not uncommon for the teacher to arrange critique sessions in which fellow students can share their ideas, feedback and opinions about each-others' work. In business-related Arts Study courses, professors with professional experience in the field share insights into how to be successful in selling, purchasing, exhibiting or otherwise supporting the art market.</p>

         <p>Welcome! The College of Sciences at Texas A&M University-Kingsville is a vibrant academic community that spans the visual and performing arts, the sciences and mathematics, and the humanities and social sciences.</p>
         <p>Our diversity is our strength. Collectively, we encourage our undergraduate and graduate students to think beyond traditional boundaries and to consider the world through multiple modes of inquiry. A strong liberal arts foundation, we believe, is the best possible preparation for a wide range of careers and for graduate study across the disciplines and in law and the health professions.</p>
         <p>In our classes, across all disciplines, we seek to inspire, challenge, and equip students to solve 21st-century problems and to be active global citizens. This approach works, as our many successful alumni can attest.</p>
         <p>Our location in Kingsville, home of the world-famous King Ranch, is ideal for students looking for a small-town environment within easy access to beautiful beaches and the more urban environments of Corpus Christi and San Antonio.</p>
         <p>We encourage you to visit our campus and discover for yourself why so many students are choosing to become Javelinas for Life.</p>
